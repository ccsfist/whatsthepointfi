## Key points

Many insurance projects build personal or community savings into the package.
For the HARITA/R4 project in Ethiopia, we offered farmers cash at the beginning of the season, gave them multiple options, including insurance and savings, and then came back at the end of the season and paid them based on what they had chosen.

Overall they put about twice as much money into premiums than savings or 6 or 7 coins out of ten into insurance ([Norton et al, 2014](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00220388.2014.887685#d1e1160)).  We have done this in projects around the world and seen similar choices.  How did this compare with what you chose?

Often, there are discussions about setting up a large humanitarian fund that can make payments the size of the insurance, based on calculations based on the error rate of the insurance.
